    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> (<b>HTML</b>) is the standard <a href="/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a><sup><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href="/wiki/Web_content">web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) and <a href="/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, a programming language.</p>
    <p><a href="/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="/wiki/Web_server">web server</a> or from local storage and <a href="/wiki/Browser_engine">render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> <a href="/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
    <p><a href="/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href="/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects">images</a> and other objects such as <a href="/wiki/Fieldset">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <a href="/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a> by denoting structural <a href="/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a>, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using <a href="/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as <code><span>&lt;</span><span>img</span><span>&gt;</span></code> and <code><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span>&gt;</span></code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <code><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></code> and <code><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></code> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a href="/wiki/Web_browser">Browsers</a> do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a <a href="/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting language</a> such as <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of <a href="/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HTML &amp; action=edit">[update]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-deprecated-4"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> A form of HTML, known as <a href="/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <code><span>&lt;</span><span>canvas</span><span>&gt;</span></code> element, together with JavaScript.</p>

  <img src="tim.jpg" alt="Tim Berners-Lee image" width= 200px>
  <p>In 1980, <a href="/wiki/Physicist">physicist</a> <a href="/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at <a href="/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.<sup><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN <a href="/wiki/Data_system">data systems</a> engineer <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <a href="/wiki/Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry.<sup><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
  <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",<sup><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<sup><a href="#cite_note-tagshtml-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/CERN_SGML">CERN SGML</a>, an in-house <a href="/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.<sup><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
  <p>HTML is a <a href="/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that <a href="/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> use to interpret and <a href="/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a> text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href="/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 <i>Techniques for using SGML</i>, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href="/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
  <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and <a href="/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML <a href="/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document type definition</a> to define the syntax.<sup><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the <a href="/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA Mosaic</a> browser's custom tag for embedding inline images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Dave_Raggett">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<sup><a href="#cite_note-html+-13"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
  <p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.<sup><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
  <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HTML&amp;action=edit">[update]</a></sup> the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C).<sup><a href="#cite_note-raggett-15"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2000, HTML became an international standard (<a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO</a>/<a href="/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission">IEC</a> 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the <a href="/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.<sup><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3>XHTML versions</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a></div>

<p>
  XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using 
  <a href="/wiki/XML">XML</a> 1.0. It is now referred to as 
  <i>the XML syntax for HTML</i> and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-60"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-61"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> 
    and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.
  </li>
  <li>
    XHTML 1.1
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> 
    was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    XHTML 2.0 was a working draft. Work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on 
    <a href="/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> and 
    <a href="/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a>.
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-64"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup>
    <sup><a href="#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> 
    XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.

<div><h3>Transition of HTML publication to WHATWG</h3></div>

</div>

<p>
  On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-W3C_transfer_blog-67"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup>
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-W3C_transfer_HTML-68"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup>
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-W3C_transfer_memo-69"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup>
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-W3C_transfer_ZDNet-70"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> 
  The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007, the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.
  <sup><a href="#cite_note-W3C_forks-71"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> 
  The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the 
  <i>de facto</i> web standard for some time.

<div><h2>Markup</h2></div>


<p>
  HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called 
  <i>tags</i> (and their <i>attributes</i>), character-based 
  <i>data types</i>, 
  <i>character references</i> and 
  <i>entity references</i>. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like 
  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and 
  <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent 
  <i>empty elements</i> and so are unpaired, for example 
  <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the 
  <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the 
  <i>end tag</i> (they are also called 
  <i>opening tags</i> and 
  <i>closing tags</i>).
</p>

<p>
  Another important component is the HTML 
  <i><a href="/wiki/Document_type_declaration">document type declaration</a></i>, which triggers 
  <a href="/wiki/Standards_mode">standards mode</a> rendering.
